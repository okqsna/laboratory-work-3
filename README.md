# laboratory-work-3
Laboratory work №3 on finite state machine on discrete math class.

>> main task was to implement your own “regex” using knowledge on the topic of finite automata, namely in this implementation a nondeterministic finite machine, and to explore how you can create your own checkings for certain patterns.
