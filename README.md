# laboratory-work-3
Laboratory work №3 on finite state machines in the discrete math class.

> The main task of this laboratory work was to implement your own “regex” using knowledge on finite machines, namely, in implementing a nondeterministic finite machine, and to explore how you can create your own checks for certain grammar patterns.
